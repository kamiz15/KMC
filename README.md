# RAG Framework with LLMs

This project implements a modular **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to enhance large language models (LLMs) using external documents. It combines dense retrieval, chunked indexing, and prompt orchestration to deliver accurate, grounded responses from up-to-date or domain-specific data.

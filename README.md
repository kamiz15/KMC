# 🔍 RAG Framework with LLMs

This project implements a modular **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system to enhance large language models (LLMs) using external documents. It combines dense retrieval, chunked indexing, and prompt orchestration to deliver accurate, grounded responses from up-to-date or domain-specific data.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Vector-based semantic search (FAISS, Chroma, or Pinecone)
- ✅ Query embedding using OpenAI / HuggingFace models
- ✅ Document chunking and indexing
- ✅ Dynamic prompt construction with Top-K retrieved context
- ✅ Pluggable LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, etc.)
- ✅ Modular agent-based architecture for subject-specialized reasoning
- ✅ Optional benchmarking and evaluation

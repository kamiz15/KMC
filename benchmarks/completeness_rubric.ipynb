It is proven that working out fastens the amount of oxygen to the brain, helping people be more concentrative and optimistic.

For example, Hanoi citizens are reported to be healthier than they were because of the availability of exercise equipment right at the local parts.

In Vietnam, there used to be a program of introducing milk into daily meals to deter malnutrition for children. After 2 years of conducting this campaign, the number of underweight children was minimised noticeably. Therefore, I completely advocate other solutions to implement to warrant the public’s general health. \n",
